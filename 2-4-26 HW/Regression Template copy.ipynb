    "Valuing expertise is important for modern life. When people have a problem, they need to know who to\n",
    "turn to for a solution to their problem. For example, when people get sick, they know that a doctor is an\n",
    "expert in the field of medicine and can help them get better. In general, experts simply know more about\n",
    "a topic than do non-experts. However, experts may be vulnerable to a particular problem of knowing so\n",
    "much. They may have the illusion that they know more about a topic than they actually do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular type of overconfidence is called *overclaiming*. Essentially, overclaiming occurs when people\n",
    "claim that they know something that is impossible to know, such as claiming to know the capital of\n",
    "Sharambia (a country that doesn’t actually exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if experts are susceptible to overclaiming, Atir, Rosenzweig, and Dunning (2015) recruited 202\n",
    "individuals from an online participant pool. They first asked participants to complete either a measure of\n",
    "self-perceived knowledge, or an overclaiming task (to test for a possible order effect, half of the\n",
    "participants completed the measure of perceived knowledge first, whereas the other half completed the\n",
    "overclaiming task first). The self-perceived knowledge questionnaire asked people to indicate their level\n",
    "of knowledge in the area of personal finance. The overclaiming task asked participants to indicate how\n",
    "much they knew about 15 terms related to personal finance (e.g., home equity). Included in the 15 items\n",
    "were three terms that do not actually exist (e.g., annualized credit). Thus, overclaiming occurred when\n",
    "participants said that they were knowledgeable about the non-existent terms. Finally, participants\n",
    "completed a test of financial literacy called the FINRA. Whereas the earlier questionnaires measured\n",
